# Simple Shell, Checks
Hello SF0120:</br>

Please add tests by cloning this repo, making a dir by the same naming
conventions I am using (task no, simple shell, task name) or, if your test
falls under a task that already has a repo, creating your test script in an
existing directory. Make sure your script is executable.</br>

There will be no checks released before the deadline. We **strongly** encourage the whole class to work together and create a suite of checks covering both regular tests and edged cases for each task.

Here is an example on how to check your shell.
Fork this repo and add more checks to help you and the rest of the class build the best simple shell possible.

## Configuration

Open the file `config` and update the variables`SHELL` and `SPATH` with your shell.
SHELL="/home/vagrant/simple_shell/a.out"</br>                            
SPATH="/home/vagrant/simple_shell/"  </br>

## Run

Usage `./check_simple_shell.bash`

## Add Your Name to AUTHORS like this:

after you have pushed a contribution to this repo, run the file
"add_to_authors.sh" and push AUTHORS to master. Your name will be added to the
list.
